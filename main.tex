\section{Introduction}
In recent years, robotics has been optimizing the monitoring and exploration of maritime and coastal scenarios through the use of multiple and sophisticated autonomous systems. 
This category includes the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), underwater robots capable of completing missions autonomously, and the Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV), vehicles that rotate on the surface of the water without a crew. The application fields are various: geological prospecting, oceanographic monitoring, military sector, etc. 
Maritime navigation is an essential aspect of the shipping industry. Path planning in a maritime scenario is the process of determining the optimal route a vessel can take from the point of departure to the destination. 

The goal of this paper is to propose a new path planning method that uses a probability map to influence the final path according to sea-weather conditions.
The algorithm has bees tested on a real scenario, where the path planning has been performed in a maritime environment in the "Gulf of Naples" (Italy) according to 
the "\textbf{Progetto ARES - Autonomous Robotics for the Extended Ship}".
% \footnote[1]{https://www.cnit.it/progetti/progetti-nazionali/progetto-ares-robotica-autonoma-per-nave-estesa/}".
Our contribution to the project is the development part of a DSS (Decision Support System) that helps the operator during a mission by providing a path planning solution 
that takes into account sea-weather conditions.
The focus will be on discussing the various challenges that arise in this area and the proposed solutions to overcome them. 
The method will be compared to some state-of-the-art techniques too.


\subsection{State-of-the-art}
\colorbox{yellow}{TODO}

\subsection{WiP}
The Leader Algorithm is a probabilistic and continuous path planning algorithm. A discrete and deterministic version has been created for those applications where the probability map does not have a high resolution and for which the execution speed is fundamental. The algorithm continues to be online.

Similarly to the case of particles, we speak here of \textit {leader cell}. All the basic mechanisms previously described remain valid: the leader cell is the one with the highest value in the entire workspace; at each iteration of the algorithm only the leader cell is diffused; the new cell is stored only if the new value is higher than the old one; the stopping criterion occurs when the leader cell and the start cell correspond.

A $3 \times 3$ kernel centered on the leader cell is used for the diffusion process. All actions have a priority of $1$. Furthermore, the outcome of a given action is certain. In any case, the current implementation does not prohibit being able to condition these two characteristics.

A cell is updated as follows:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:weight_update_disc}
    \nu_i = \nu(\mathcal{L}_i) + \log p(s,a) + R(s)
\end{equation*}
where $\nu_i$ is the value  of the new cell $i$, $\nu(\mathcal{L}_i)$ is the value of the leader cell, $\log p(s,a)$ is the value associated to the state-action pair(in particular, greater weight is given to steps taken diagonally) and $R(s)$ is the reward associated with the state $s$. Notice how, unlike the continuous version, the transition takes place in log-space.


\subsection{Our contribution}
\colorbox{yellow}{TODO}


\section{Method}
%The Sum Product Algorithm (SPA) is a well-known technique in the field of probabilistic graphical models, used to efficiently calculate the marginal probabilities of variables in a factor graph. In recent years, researchers have applied the SPA to the problem of path planning in robotics and autonomous vehicles.  The SPA can be used to compute the probability of a robot successfully reaching a destination, given the current state of the environment, such as the presence of obstacles or the position of other objects. This approach allows for more efficient and accurate path planning, as it takes into account the uncertainty inherent in real-world environments. 
%By leveraging the power of probabilistic inference techniques like the SPA, researchers are making significant strides towards creating more robust and effective path planning systems for a wide range of applications.
%The probabilistic frame espoused in this work is grounded on Factor Graphs (FG) that represent a unified way of rephrasing directed and undirected probabilistic graphical models in an easy- to- manipulate forward and backward communication propagation (signal inflow). Our work on FG in reduced normal form (FGrn) has further simplified the FG frame reducing the network to interconnections of single-input single-output (SISO) blocks and diverters. Probability consistence can be fluently propagated for conclusion and literacy. Seminal work on FG can be set up in and; some details on the optimized executions of FGrn can be set up in.

%p_{(S_tA_t)^i}(s_ta_t) \propto  b_{(S_tA_t)^i}(s_ta_t) f_{(S_tA_t)^i}(s_ta_t), ~~~t=1,...,T; ~~i=1,2,3. 
%\label{eq:post}
%\end{equation}

In our work, we consider a discrete environment of size $N\times M$ and the considered agent can move in eight directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal directions.
Using a discrete representation of the environment, each cell of the grid, that rapresent the possible states of the agent, can be associated with a variable $r_{i,j}$ (Reward), 
where $i$ and $j$ are the row and column indices of the cell, respectively. The value of $r_{i,j}$ is 1 if the cell is occupied and 0 if the cell is completly free of obstacles or 
a value between 0 and 1 whereever there is an higher or lower preference to move in that cell. The agent can move from one cell to another only if the destination cell is free.\\

The reward function $r_{i,j}$ is a function of the current state of the environment, and it is assumed to be known to the agent. 
This function has been obtained by modeling the input dataset and it will be discussed in the next section.\\

\subsection{Input data}
The developed module takes as input several sets of data divided into:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data for the construction of the parameterized map: wave motion 
\item Mission data: mission objectives, \colorbox{green}{NG Worker} start and goal positions, drone release positions(Intermediate positions), 
	mission duration, etc.;
\end{itemize}

All the weather data are provided by the \colorbox{green}{PARTHENOPE\footnote[2]{http://193.205.230.6:8080/opendap/hyrax/}}. The data are provided in the form of a netCDF file,
which is a self-describing file format that allows the storage of multidimensional arrays of scientific data and they are used to store both the map and the reward function.
As input data for the construction of the reward function, the following parameters are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Significant height of wind and swell waves(see figure \ref*{fig:waveHeight}).
\item Peak direction(see figure \ref*{fig:pDir}).
\item Costal map(see figure \ref*{fig:coast}).
\end{itemize}

The significant height of the waves information has been used to get the informations about the Sea State.The term Sea State describes the general condition of the surface of the open sea. 
This is comprised of two core measurements, the wave height which is dependent on the local surface wind strength and thus termed the ‘wind sea’ and the swell which i
s a slow and regular movement of the sea in rolling waves that do not break and are in the process of dissipating as they travel from their relatively distant origin.\\
The sea state is described by the following chart: \\

\newcolumntype{C}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}X}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{CCC}
\toprule
\textbf{Code}	& \textbf{Height [m]}	& \textbf{Description}\\
\midrule
0		& no wave			& Calm (Glassy)\\
1		& 0 - 0.10			& Calm (Rippled) \\
2		& 0.10 - 0.50			& Smooth (Wavelets) \\
3		& 0.50 - 1.25			& Slight \\
4		& 1.25 - 2.50			& Moderate \\
5		& 2.50 - 4.00			& Rough \\
6		& 4.00 - 6.00			& Very Rough\\
7		& 6.00 - 9.00			&  High\\
8		& 9.00 - 14.00			& Very High \\
9		& 14.00+			& Phenomenal \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

Those informations are transformed in a probabilistic fashion using values from 0 to 1, where 0 means sea state 0 and 1 sea state greater or equal to 4.\\
Sea state greater then 4 are considered as the same because the considered agent (NG Worker) is not able to operate in those conditions.\\

The coast map is a binary map where 1 represents the presence of a coast and 0 the absence of a coast. This map has been processed applying a Gaussian filter to the original map 
to create a smooth transition between the coast and the sea to create different zones to avoiding collisions of the results path with the coast as shown in figure \ref*{fig:coastBlur}.\\

	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The reward function is obtained by combining the three parameters in a weighted sum and then normalizing the result in the range [0,1].\\

\subsection{Communication}
The communication between all the components of the DSS can comunicate through a MQTT broker.
MQTT or Message Queue Telemetry Transport is a featherlight and effective message protocol developed for the Internet of effects( IoT). 
It allows bias to change data in a publish- subscribe model, where data is published by a sender and entered by one or further subscribers. The protocol is grounded on a customer- garçon armature where guests can publish or subscribe to motifs on a garçon( also known as a broker). MQTT is ideal for IoT bias because it consumes minimum bandwidth and has low above, making it able for low- authority and resource- constrained bias. 
Its simplicity, scalability, and trustability have made it popular with inventors and has come a standard-issue protocol in the IoT assiduity.
An MQTT broker is a intermediary mecca that acts as a communication broker between MQTT guests. It's responsible for entering, storing, and ranking dispatches between guests. When an MQTT customer publishes a communication to a special content, the broker receives the communication and forwards it to all acceded guests that are interested in that content. also, when an MQTT customer subscribes to a content, the broker stores the subscription and forwards any dispatches published on that content to the acceded customer.

On the other phase, an MQTT customer is a device or operation that communicates with an MQTT broker. It can be either a publisher, subscriber, or both. When a customer publishes a communication to a special content, it sends the communication to the broker, which also on it to all acceded guests. When a customer subscribes to a content, it sends a subscription request to the broker, which stores the subscription and forwards any dispatches published on that content to the acceded customer.

In summary, the MQTT broker acts as an conciliator between MQTT guests, entering and ranking dispatches, while the MQTT guests are the bias or operations that give with the broker, publishing and assenting to dispatches. Together, the MQTT broker and guests form a publish- subscribe network, allowing effective and dependable message in IoT surroundings.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
